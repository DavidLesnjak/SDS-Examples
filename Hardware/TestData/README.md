# About this application

This is a standalone test application that uses  [SDS Recorder](https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework)
to record test input and output data.

This example is pre-configured for the STMicroelectronics [STM32H743I-EVAL](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32h743i-eval.html) board.

It uses the Ethernet interface to record the data on the host computer.

Test input data:
- test data generated by the application to simulate IMU sensor data

Test output data:
- test data generated by the application to simulate the ML output data

Examples of 7 seconds of recorded data are available in the `./SDS Recordings` subfolder, which also contains the
`.sds.yml` metadata files.
